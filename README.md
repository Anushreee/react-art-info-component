It is a react component which  displays arts.
If you are interested in a particular art, you can check for more info by clicking on the info toggle, or look at another art.

If you dont like a particular art you can delete it, by hovering over the image and it displays the delete icon. You can
click on the button and the art is removed. And, this way we can get rid of all the arts. 

In this version, i am using the local data.

The project is responsive. It is the mobile first approach. In smaller screens the image lies on top of the information
area. In bigger screens the image and the information are displayed side by side.

Technologies Used:

create-react-app, SASS, CSS Modules, React, Git
